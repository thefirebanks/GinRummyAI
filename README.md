# TestingGummy

Use functions within TestingGin.cpp to run code in the current most visually responsive way. 
Include extra print staments if necessary 
Use main function in main.cpp to run and choose tests. These can be entered and called directly in the file. 
If you are able to pinpoint any bugs within our code, we would appreciate the tips immensely. 

Interspersed throughout the code, there are various print statements ("BRO") to check coding. Hope you don't mind. We were desparate. and still are.
