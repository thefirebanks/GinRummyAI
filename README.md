# TestingGummy

Use functions within TestingGin.cpp to run code in the current most visually responsive way. 
Include extra print staments if necessary 
Use main function in main.cpp to run and choose tests. These can be entered and called directly in the file. 
If you are able to pinpoint any bugs within our code, we would appreciate the tips immensely. 

Interspersed throughout the code, there are various print statements ("BRO") to check coding. Hope you don't mind. We were desparate. and still are. 

Also the final GUI was made after a lot of time was put into failed attempts at using OpenGl in XCode, and OpenGL in Qt, before finally we settle on the text based version we presented. Then after this there was not very much time to integrate it with the various classes we made, especially since we were not sure how to integrate it before the game program was finished, which it never was. To use the widget, download Qt Creator and Qt 5.10.
