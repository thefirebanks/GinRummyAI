# TestingGummy

Use functions within TestingGin.cpp to run code in the current most visually responsive way. 
Include extra print staments if necessary 
Use main function in main.cpp to run and choose tests. Use ginstate.cpp to run AI.
If you are able to pinpoint any bugs within our code, we would appreciate the tips immensely.
